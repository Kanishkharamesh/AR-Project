# Marker-Based AR Project with Unity and Vuforia

This project demonstrates the use of **Marker-Based Augmented Reality (AR)** and **Human Body Tracking** using Unity and Vuforia. It consists of two separate APKs:

1. **Marker-Based AR APK**: Displays 3D models of a skeleton and a sternum when their respective image targets are detected.
2. **Human Body Tracking APK**: Tracks and overlays AR elements on a human body using advanced tracking techniques.

---

## Features

### Marker-Based AR
- Utilizes **multiple image targets** to trigger specific 3D objects.
- Displays a **skeleton** model or a **sternum** model depending on the detected image.
- Developed using **Unity** and **Vuforia** for precise image recognition and object rendering.

### Human Body Tracking
- Tracks human body movement in real time.
- Overlays AR elements dynamically, enhancing interactivity.
- Provides an intuitive and immersive AR experience.

## File Structure

### APK Files
- **Marker-Based AR APK**: Triggers 3D models when specific image markers are scanned.
- **Human Body Tracking APK**: Provides AR overlays and tracking functionality.

### Project Files

- **Unity Project Output Images**: Includes complete images showcasing the outputs of the project setup for both APKs.

---

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- An Android device for testing the APKs.
- Printed image targets (for the marker-based AR APK).

### Steps for Marker-Based AR
1. Install the **Marker-Based AR APK** on your Android device.
2. Prepare the printed image targets for the skeleton and sternum models.
3. Launch the APK and point your camera at the image targets:
   - Skeleton image → **Displays the skeleton model**.
   - Sternum image → **Displays the sternum model**.

### Steps for Human Body Tracking
1. Install the **Human Body Tracking APK** on your Android device.
2. Launch the APK and allow it to access the device's camera.
3. Stand in front of the camera and observe how the AR overlays respond to body movements.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Unity**: Game engine used for creating the AR applications.
- **Vuforia**: AR development platform for marker-based AR.
- **3D Modeling**: Custom 3D models for the skeleton and sternum.
- **APK Packaging**: Applications exported as APKs for easy deployment.

---

## Highlights

- **Precision Tracking**: Vuforia's robust image recognition ensures accurate model placement.
- **Interactive Experience**: Body tracking APK creates an engaging and dynamic AR environment.
- **Multi-Target Support**: Multiple image targets enable rich AR interactions.

---

## Potential Applications

- **Education**: Enhance anatomy learning with interactive 3D models of skeletal structures.
- **Healthcare**: Visualize human body parts for medical training or patient education.
- **AR Demonstrations**: Showcase marker-based AR and body tracking capabilities.

---

## Future Improvements
- Add **voice commands** for interacting with 3D models.
- Extend body tracking features to include gesture recognition.
- Integrate additional AR models for broader educational use.
